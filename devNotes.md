# Building a blog notes

1. Working through vulnerability
2. Set up ESLint with prettier
3. gatsby starter project doesn't include latest verions of gatsby... or maybe it does, gatsby-cli and gatsby are different but the same.
4. Ummm all the files in the starter (such as the css) were getting in ma ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡±
5. Therefore, created a Gatsby site without the gatsby-cli command, manually created all the files and imported the packages. Good learning experience.
