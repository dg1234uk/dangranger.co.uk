Hello, my name is Daniel Granger. This is my first post on my first blog. I am currently a hobbyist full-stack JavaScript developer, though my goal for 2019 is to turn this hobby into some sort of freelance work.

This blog has one sole intention, to give my hobby a focus. For a long time, I have tinkered with projects, but with no real end goal. Now I will have somewhere to write about these projects and publish the result. If no one ever reads anything I publish here, then that doesn't matter as long as it helps me focus on whatever I decide to do. The additional benefit of writing about my projects is that it will serve as a notebook of my thoughts at the time. Also, hopefully the process of writing about what I did or discovered will help consolidate what I learnt.

## Creation of the blog

So, I took the plunge and created a blog site. It's been built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which is a static site generator that uses the frontend framework [React](https://reactjs.org/). For the current design of the site, I used the design of one of the Gatsby Starters, `gatsby-starter-lumen`. So thank you to [Alexander Shelepenok](https://github.com/alxshelepenok) for not only creating this starter but also for releasing to the community for free.

## Upcoming

So I'm excited to start producing content for this blog. I'm looking forward to writing about the process I went through to produce this site and some of the issues I had to solve to get it working as I wanted.
