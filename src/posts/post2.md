## Welcome to the new blog

If I was to type a new blog post it would go something a bit like this. How do you feel about it? Let's try inline code highlight `js›alert('Not working');`

### Anyway

Here's some code... hopefully I can highlight `css›.some-class { background-color: red }` with CSS syntax.

```js{numberLines: true}
console.log("Hello World");
// Need to add a long line... type a new blog post it would go something bit like this. How do you feel about it? // highlight-line
```
